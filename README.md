# Raspberry-PI-Q
Heavily influenced by @justindean and his [PitmasterPI](https://github.com/justindean/PitmasterPi) project, I decided to create an advanced BBQ temperature controller using a Raspberry PI (RPI) for kamado style grills (like the Big Green Egg). The goals of the project were the following:
* Make delicious and consistently great BBQ
* Use RPI to control the fan and thus the temperature of the charcoal
* Use RPI and predictive algorithms to let me know the exact time when my meat will reach the desired temperature
* Use RPI and email/text notifications if my desired intent is not met
* Make it affordable
* Create cool dashboards to show off my cooking

The biggest difference of this project from the one @justindean created is the fact that i wanted to be able to have two thermocouples so that i can also monitor the temperature of the meat. Using simple growth rate math, I can use all these data to predict when my BBQ would reach the desired temperature. The updated BOM is listed below.

## Competition
If you are looking for non-DIY alternatives, the products from [BBQ Guru](http://www.bbqguru.com/) seem to fit the bill
* CyberQ offers almost identical functionality for $329
* DigiQ offers smoker and meat temperature control without any alerting/notifications or internet access for $219
* PartyQ only offers smoker temperature control for $150

## Wiring Instructions
* Look at the PIN numbers of the RPI on the pictures listed below before you get started. Also look at some of my detailed pictures and follow the color coding of the wires
* Connect the Robogaia dual thermocouple plate
  * The plate fits flush on top of the RPI on one end of the RPI extensibility connectors. Look at the pictures below as well as the documentation at http://www.robogaia.com/raspberry-pi-dual-thermocouple-plate.html for more details
* Connect the relay to the Robogaia plate and the RPI
  * Useful post: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUNBAXRMMUMBL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTEN3TM
  * Useful video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQyntQLazMU
  * There are two rows of input pins (GND IN1 IN2 IN3 IN4 VCC) on the relay board and (JD-VCC VCC) with the latter coming with a jumper bridging the pins
    * Keep the jumper for (JD-VCC VCC) on
    * Connect a wire from GND on your device (pin #6) to GND on the relay module
    * Connect a wire from the 5V pin on your device (pin #2) to the VCC pin that is adjacent to IN4 (not the one next to JD-VCC!)
    * Finally hook the GPIO 26 (pin #37) up to IN2 
    * Set the pin to 'low' or 0V in the software to activate and 'high' or 3.3V-5V to deactivate
  * Run `sudo python3 relay_tester.py` from the source code below to test the relay on/off operations
* Splice the power source for the 12v DC power source for the fan and have it go through the relay IN2 so that the relay can control the on/off power supply for the fan
* Connect the two K thermocouples to the correct +/- on the Robogaia plate
  * Look at the wiring pictures below that have labelled which is the Meat and which is the Grill thermocouple
* Connect the power supply to the RPI. Micro-USB power supply has to be at least 2 amps

## Development Instructions
* Install Python for Windows
* Install Visual Studio Code with the python extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python
* Install PIP as per instructions from https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
* Create an account with www.dweet.io and www.freeboard.io. You don't need to pay for a locked object. You can create your own board and save it with your own dashboard analytics for this project
  * Use the two files below to enhance and create your own html-based dashboards on freeboard
* Create an account with www.gmx.com to get a free email address
* Create an account with www.grovestreams.com. 
  * Create an organization and under advanced enable the "Raspberry PI Metrics" blueprint
  * For more details, read https://www.grovestreams.com/developers/getting_started_rpi.html
  * Once your account is created, go to the Dashboard and click on Admin>API Keys>Click on Feed Put API Key>View Secret Key. You need to save this key as this is needed as input to the Raspberry-PI-Q. See below for more details.
  * For your streams\components, create at least two notifications via email (free). When you create the notification, make sure to select an "Action Package" 
		 * A value condition event notification so that you are notified if your meat or grill falls out of any specific ranges
		 * A latency event so that you are notified immediately if data is not coming from the RPI, which means something went wrong. This is a very simplistic type of outside-in monitoring

## Startup Operations
**__Perform these steps every time you grill!__**
* Light up a couple of charcoal brickets in your grill
* Attach the fan plate to your input air vent as per pictures
* Open the output vent on top of your egg slightly as per pictures
* Power up the RPI and attach the power source for the fan
* SSH using putty.exe (https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe to download)
  * Enter the IP address for your RPI as outlined below in the __Host Name__ field and then select __SSH__ and click __Open__
  * IP address: 192.168.1.13. Find it using https://dweet.io/follow/Raspberry-PI-Q-IPAddress 3-4 minutes after your device starts
  * A terminal window will now open
  * Username: pi
  * Password: [whatever you set in the instructions to update the password above]
* Once you login you will get access to the RPI's operating system
* `cd /home/pi/Raspberry-PI-Q/`
* Run the command to start the Raspberry-PI-Q. Alternatively you can visit `http://192.168.1.14/index.php` to do it from the graphical interface
  * `sudo python3 Raspberry-PI-Q.py 180 225 125 email@address.com 5 30 Raspberry-PI-Q-Michael ff83612c-6814-466e-bd51-5d55039c184e &`
  * _All temperatures are in fahrenheit_
  * 1st parameter: 180 is the setup temperature of the grill. The fan will run continuously until this temperature is reached
  * 2nd parameter: 225 is the desired temperature of the grill. The program will turn on/off the fan to maintain this temperature
  * 3rd parameter: 125 is the desired temperature of the meat. Insert the probe in the meat and we will predict the time when it will be ready
  * 4th parameter: This is the email address for notifications. You can alternatively use 10digitphonenumber@txt.att.net or 10digitphonenumber@tmomail.net for email-to-text
  * 5th parameter: This is the interval in minutes you want to receive regular updates and notifications. Alerts will come immediately
  * 6th parameter: This is the interval in seconds that each loop will take. if set to 30 seconds, assume the fan will run X seconds every 30 seconds. You can adjust this for more or less fan time during your interval
  * 7th parameter: This is the unique name for your device that you want to use for tracking analytics on Dweet, Freeboard, and Grovestreams
    * i.e. Raspberry-PI-Q-Michael
  * 8th parameter: This is the unique application API ID you get from your grovestreams account as per instructions above
    * i.e. ff83612c-6814-466e-bd51-5d55039c184e
* Press `ctrl-c` to exit the program and terminate the monitoring by Raspberry-PI-Q
* Adjust the voltage to the fan according to weather conditions and size of grill. 4-6 volts should work great
* Visit https://dweet.io/follow/Raspberry-PI-Q-Michael [Change the URL to match your 7th parameter] for the raw data
* Visit freeboard.io/board/[your board id that you created earlier] for the dashboard
* Visit https://www.grovestreams.com/observationStudio.html for the charts and alerts  
* Shutdown the RPI before removing the power cord using `sudo shutdown -h now`

## Future Ideas
Some things I want to explore for a v2 of this project include
* Use most of the same hardware to create a sous vide immersion circulator
* Add a high-heat camera to take pictures of my meat _inside_ the grill
* Adopt the Facebook Messenger Bot architecture to create a bot for my Raspberry-PI-Q
